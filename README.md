fabawag is a final project by Gvir Aviv, Bill Bonnefil, Michael Casey, and Brian Lee.

This app attempts to help sports fans in new cities find a bar with a certain affiliation to a team and/or is showing a game.

The inspiration for this app came from the lack of information available on the web to find where non-hometeam games are playing.

Please find our app at the following link:

'TBD'

This is the original source code for the app.

This app currently supports only football games/teams and bars in San Francisco.
